# React Portfolio

## Description

This is my react portfolio. It still needs a little bit of work but it has an About Me, a Projects page, a Contact Me, and a resume with a downloadable link. Down below in the footer are tabs with icons which will navigate you to my linkedIn, Github, Resume, and back to the home Page. I learned how to use react and become more familiar with it and building pages.

## Installation

There are no installations required. There will be a link below and you will just have to click and it is deployed.
